          <p>I am extremely passionate about music and the electronic music space -- primarily in the realms of music production, audio engineering, sound design, and editing. Below is a sample of the work I have completed across various college courses.</p>

          <h4>PORTFOLIO</h4>

          <h5>Cornell Sound Design</h5>
          <h6>TRIANGULATION PROJECT</h6>
          <p>Below is a project I completed for Sound Design, a course at Cornell University. The video with no sound was provided to us by my instructor, and we were given creative liberty to design the sound for the video. The background music was composed, produced, and mixed by me using Logic Pro. I then worked in Pro Tools and combined my composition with sound effects to design and create a complete soundscape for the video. The sound effects were part of a very large sfx library provided by my instructor, but I selected which effects to use and modified them slightly (e.g. using time stretch) to better align them with the video. For instance, some sound effects I used were people breaking glass, squishing plastic water bottles, and stepping on ice, which I manipulated to fit the timing of the video. The placement of sound effects throughout the mix and the trajectory of my music composition were my decision.</p>

          <h5>NYU Mix Intensive</h5>
          <h6>"THE FIRE" BY THE ROOTS FT. JOHN LEGEND</h6>

          <p> My final project for Mix Intensive, a course I took at NYU over the summer, was a mix of The Roots & John Legend's "The Fire." I worked on the mix throughout the 3-week duration of the course and updated it as I learned more and more skills. The course was taught by Jason Goldstein, the original mix engineer of the song, and he showed us numerous mixing and pre-mastering techniques that we were able to apply to our mixes. The mix was completed using Pro Tools DAW software and mostly using stock plugins.</p>

          <h5>Introduction to Computer Music</h5>
          <h6>MUSIC CONCRETE ASSIGNMENT</h6>

          <p>I recorded, produced, and mixed this short project for Introduction to Computer Music, a class I took at Cornell. For this assignment, I was challenged to record samples, process them, and turn them into a mix. Every sound used in this mix was recorded myself using a Zoom tape recorder -- some sounds include cars passing by, snapping, clapping, wind and water sounds, and dropping my phone on a table. I processed, chopped up, and manipulated the samples to better fit into the mix. For instance, I used a clip of me closing my car door and turned it into a kick drum. I also recorded a snippet of my a cappella group singing Kansas' "Carry on Wayward Son," put a phaser on it, and chopped it up throughout the mix for a techno effect (I also used the clip as an impulse response on a reverb that I placed on a sample of a motorcycle driving). This mix was completed in Logic Pro.</p>

          <h5>Computing on Earth</h5>
          <h6>PSA VIDEO #1</h6>

          <p>Computing on Earth was a seminar I took at Cornell centered around the environmental impact of computing. As part of a final project, I worked in a group to create a series of PSA videos regarding the environmentally damaging cycle of using and producing technology in the modern era. For the video below, I designed the sound by myself. More specifically, I composed, produced, and mixed a music composition that went along with the video's theme and progression using Logic Pro. I also mixed the composition with the camera audio, which included dialogue and sound effects. </p>

          <h5>Computing on Earth</h5>

          <p>For this second PSA video below as part of the same course, I designed the sound by myself. More specifically, I composed, produced, and mixed a music composition that went along with the video's theme and progression using Logic Pro. I also mixed the composition with the camera audio, which included dialogue and sound effects.</p>

          <h5>NYU DAWs: Logic Pro</h5>
          <h6>TECHNO MIXING PROJECT</h6>

          <p>Below is a project that I completed as part of a course at NYU. All materials and tracks were provided by my instructor other than a guitar part that I recorded. Mixed using Logic Pro.</p>

          <h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>

          <p>Music has been a common thread throughout my entire life; I’ve been singing and performing since I was young, and when I got a bit older I taught myself how to play a few instruments (guitar, piano, bass, and ukulele). I then began experimenting with music production in early high school when I started writing my own songs and wanted to produce/record them — and this sparked a passion in me for creating electronic music. At Cornell, I’ve been able to complement my own explorations by taking a few sound design/electronic music classes, and I also completed an independent study on building audio tools and VST plugins using Max MSP and Max For Live. Additionally, I took a few summer courses in audio engineering/music production at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute in 2022. In 2023, I had the joy of completing an internship with SiriusXM, where I was able to gain audio editing experience in a professional setting; I was able to edit numerous artist interviews and host voice tracks that went to air. I love working on audio projects and researching new techniques in my spare time, and I am also in the process of recording, editing, and mixing an album for my a cappella group! </p>
