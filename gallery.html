                    <p>I created this poster for The Key Elements Co-Ed A Cappella this past fall. It was for our annual Rocktoberfest concert, which was themed to Avatar! I additionally edited the background of each button, added overlays and effects using the apps Procreate and Repix, and created the poster's backdrop using Procreate.</p>

                    <p>This is a poster I created for The Key Elements Co-Ed A Cappella's 30th Anniversary Concert this past spring, BacKE to the Future! I additionally edited the background of each button that is featured in the grid and created the backdrop behind the grid. Since our theme was decades/Back To The Future/time travel, I tried to emulate themes from the movie, and I also picked backgrounds for each button in the grid based on the decade each member chose to be "from."</p>

                    <p>I created this poster for my a cappella group's spring audition period. It features buttons from our fall concert, and the backdrop is a filtered button from the concert as well. The intent behind this design was to make it easy to interpret such that our group could maximize the number of auditions we had.</p>

                    <p>I designed this poster for my a cappella group's fall audition period. I designed the backdrop on Procreate and used buttons from old concerts and an event we had last year. This was the first poster I designed for my a cappella group -- it serves to demonstrate how far I've grown as a graphic designer just over this past year!</p>

I did this in relation to the album being recorded remotely during the height of the pandemic. Check out our album below!

                    <p>This is a close up of one of the profile buttons I created for Avatar: The Last Element! "Profile buttons" are a form of personalized promotional material that we use to spread the word about our performances. Since our theme was Avatar, each button was edited to represent the "nation" each member was from (determined based on voice part). Here, Sara was from fire nation! The flames were edited on by me using Procreate.</p>

                    <p>I created this Instagram story graphic to promote A Cappella United, a concert involving performances by all of Cornell's a cappella groups! This graphic was used by every group to promote the concert. I made the background myself using Procreate.</p>
