          <p>Over the past two years, I have developed a passion for audio engineering and sound design. Much of my spare time is spent working on mixes, researching more information, and exploring new products and techniques. To further my interests, I completed a course at Cornell and supplemental courses at New York University, where I vastly expanded my skillset and worked with professionals in the field on mixing projects. I have additionally worked on my own projects and have developed skills through experimentation.</p>

          <h4>CLASS PROJECTS / PORTFOLIO</h4>

          <h5>Cornell Sound Design -- Triangulation Project </h5>
          <p>Below is a project I completed for Sound Design, a course at Cornell University. The video with no sound was provided to us by my instructor, and we were given creative liberty to design the sound for the video. The background music was composed, produced, and mixed by me using Logic Pro. I then worked in Pro Tools and combined my composition with sound effects to design and create a complete soundscape for the video. The sound effects were part of a very large sfx library provided by my instructor, but I selected which effects to use and modified them slightly (e.g. using time stretch) to better align them with the video. For instance, some sound effects I used were people breaking glass, squishing plastic water bottles, and stepping on ice, which I manipulated to fit the timing of the video. The placement of sound effects throughout the mix and the trajectory of my music composition were my decision.</p>

          <h5>Cornell Sound Design -- Contact Project </h5>
          <p>Below is a project I completed for Sound Design, a course at Cornell University. The video with no sound was provided to us by my instructor, and we were given creative liberty to design the sound for the video. The background music was composed, produced, and mixed by me using Logic Pro. I then worked in Pro Tools and combined my composition with sound effects to design and create a complete soundscape for the video. The sound effects were part of a very large sfx library provided by my instructor, but I selected which effects to use and modified them slightly (e.g. using time stretch) to better align them with the video. More specifically, some of the effects that I used and modified were explosion sounds, people playing with rocks, spaceship and techno sounds, and whoosh sound effects. The placement of sound effects and the trajectory of my music composition were my decision. </p>

          <h5>NYU Mix Intensive Final Project -- The Fire by The Roots ft. John Legend </h5>
          <p>Below is my final project for Mix Intensive, a course I took at NYU over the summer. It is my mix of The Roots & John Legend's "The Fire." I worked on the mix throughout the 3-week duration of the course and updated it as I learned more and more techniques. Mix was completed using Pro Tools DAW software and mostly using stock plugins. Materials were provided to me by my course instructor.</p>

          <h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>

          <p>Much of my experience has been through completing independent projects. For my classes at NYU, I mixed songs in a variety of genres, from electronic music to RnB to heavy metal to alternative. I additionally have experience mixing scores, dialogue, and sound effects for video.</p>
